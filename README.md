# Metis---Classification

# Summary
The goal of this project was to use a classification model to predict whether new dogs admitted to the Austin Animal
Shelter in Texas were more likely to be adopted or euthanized. This would allow the shelter to allocate limited resources
towards overcoming euthaniasia trends or prioritizing the dogs more likely to be adopted. The data is publicly available on
kaggle.com. The data was already clean but feature engineering was required to make it usable. A logistic regression was
used as a preliminary model which was then exceeded by a Naive Bayes ensemble.
